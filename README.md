# Genetic Algorithm for Food Recommendation System

### Purpose 
To create a simple program able to show several choices of "4-sehat-5-sempurna" combinations of food diet, given a maximum total calories as input.

### Notes
The project uses a manually created foodback database that contains popular dishes (along with their respective calories) for every available category; protein, vegetables, fruits, and carbohydrates. Every meal choice will contain a dish from each category, allowing a full and healthy meal for the individual. <br>
In terms of Genetic Algorithm, the resulting choices are 'individuals' picked through tournament selection form the population. <br>
